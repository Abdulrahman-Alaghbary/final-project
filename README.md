Automatic Image Colorization Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates automatic colorization of black and white images using deep neural networks. By leveraging a pre-trained model, the script takes a grayscale image as input and produces a colorized version of the image.

Features:
Utilizes a deep neural network model for image colorization.
Includes a script to load the model and perform colorization on black and white images.
Provides a straightforward command-line interface for input image specification.
Displays both the original and colorized images for visual comparison.
Saves the colorized output image for further use.
Usage:
Download the necessary model files and dependencies specified in the code.
Run the script with a black and white image as input to generate a colorized version.

```shell
$ python colorize.py -i imagepath
```
or you can use this instead
```shell
$ python colorize.py --image imagepath
```

View the original and colorized images side by side for comparison.
Save the colorized image for further analysis or sharing.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different black and white images to witness the magic of automatic image colorization!
